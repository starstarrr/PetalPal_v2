# 🚀 Getting Started

## Option 1 (Recommended): Run with Docker

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

cd PetalPal
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
```

Build and start the application:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Stop the application:

```bash
docker compose down
```

For future runs:

```bash
docker compose up
```

---

## Option 2: Run without Docker

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd client

npm install

cd ..
```

Generate Prisma Client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Sync the database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

Start the backend:

```bash
npm start
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd client

npm run dev
```

# 🐳 Docker Architecture

PetalPal uses a multi-stage Docker build.

```text
Stage 1
React + Vite Build
        │
        ▼
client/dist
        │
        ▼
Stage 2
Express Production Server
        │
        ├── REST API
        ├── Socket.IO
        └── React Static Files
```

The Express server serves both the backend API and the compiled React frontend from the same container.

---

# 🌍 Deployment

PetalPal is deployed using:

- Render
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM

The production Express server serves the compiled React application (`client/dist`) together with the REST API and Socket.IO endpoints under the same origin.

---

# ⭐ Engineering Highlights

- Designed a normalized PostgreSQL schema using Prisma ORM.
- Built modular RESTful APIs with Express.
- Developed a React component-based frontend architecture.
- Implemented real-time synchronization using Socket.IO.
- Designed a live friend request workflow with instant updates.
- Optimized UI responsiveness with partial state updates.
- Built an interactive calendar for exploring mood history.
- Containerized the full-stack application using Docker with a multi-stage build.
- Configured Express to serve the production React application.
- Structured the application into reusable React components.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Jest unit testing
- Swagger API documentation
- Push notifications
- Online presence indicators
- Mobile responsive optimization
